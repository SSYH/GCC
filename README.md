Per the recommendations blogged at [Knowledge Federation
Journal](http://kfjournal.org/wp/index.php/2015/10/19/9-artifacts-to-seed-a-project-team/),
this GitHub repository is set up to align with that structure. Though
each of these folders identifies one of the components of that
recommendation, some point to other platforms / tools that are NOT
provided by GitHub.

As is with all matters (TODO: link to HOWTO RFC here), improvement
(hopefully, eventually) happens, and is expected.
